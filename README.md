# Evil Maid of Babylon
> "And the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet...
having a golden cup full of abominations"

## üèõÔ∏è Overview
Version: **1.4 alpha**

This is a cryptography library for those who are not afraid to live

Written from scratch by a single person,
it embodies the spirit of rolling your own cryptography

There's no certifications, money going to corporations,
or experts bribed in the process of making it

## üî• Ritual

### Requirements
- A C99 compiler

### Forging the Seal
Files are forged in `build`
```sh
make
build/maid test
```

### Binding the System
Files are placed in `/usr/local`
```sh
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### Wielding
The library can be wielded with -lmaid, and a command-line tool `maid` is
available
